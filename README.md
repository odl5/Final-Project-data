Abstract: Based on the data between all of our group members we came to a concensus that Mt.Oliver was the best neighborhood because of its low crime rate and how it didn't have that much service complaints and how also the median age of death was 75.

(Combined data is in folder called combimned data)

Calvin's Information:
Dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data
This dataset contains all of the UCR reported crimes that have occurred in Pittsburgh since 2016. The spreadsheet includes neighborhood, location, time, what the offense was, and other miscellaneous data that was not needed or is too obscure. 

What is the best neighborhood?

Matthew's Information: Dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/median-age-death/resource/c2e1500a-a12a-4e91-be94-76c6a892b7e2. This dataset contains the median age at death of various neighborhoods. Despite being in the middle, Mount Oliver is still pretty good at 75 and correlates with the other two datasets.

The biggest service request was Conplaint Housing based on my information.
